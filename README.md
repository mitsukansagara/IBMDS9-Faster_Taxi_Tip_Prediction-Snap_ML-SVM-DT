# IBMDS9-Faster_Taxi_Tip_Prediction-Snap_ML-SVM-DT


Consolidate my machine learning (ML) modeling skills by using a popular regression model: Decision Tree.   
The dataset includes information about taxi tip and was collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology providers authorized under the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP). I have trained model to predict the amount of tip paid.    
     
Used the Scikit-Learn Python interface and Python API offered by the Snap Machine Learning (Snap ML) library. Snap ML is a high-performance IBM library for ML modeling. It provides highly-efficient CPU/GPU implementations of linear models and tree-based models. Snap ML not only accelerates ML algorithms through system awareness, but it also offers novel ML algorithms with best-in-class accuracy.
